## Notes:
The scripts found here were used on subjects from Wisconsin university to co-register the trigger signal with the recorded iEEG signals (as both were recorded on different systems). This procedure was applied locally on the site before sharing the raw data, and is available here only for reference purposes. It should not be applied on the data at any points.
